archiveCollection(String tokenMintAddress)
|
-> Archives Collection if collection name is not cataloged already.
|   |
|   -> Calls getTokenURI(tokenMintAddress) to get the collection URI link
|        |
|        -> Then calls gatherMetaData(URL) to start collecting all gather all meta data 
|            |
|            -> Examines the end of the link for a /123.json or 123 then goes to 0
|            -> Repeatedly gets links from 0 to infinity until the response is no item found
|            -> Then calls sortMetaData(String metadata) to sort metadata into a json file with all collection data
|                    |
|                    -> sortMetaData calculates rarity attributes and puts it on top, and creates an entry for each nft in 
|                       the collection along with its statistical rarity. This way the data is pre sorted pre calculated so 
|                       when user searches a collection not much is done.
|
-> If already cataloged doesn't do anything.
